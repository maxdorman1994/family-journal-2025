# How to Get Your Code to GitHub

## 🎯 **Option 1: Find the Push Button**

Look carefully in your Builder.io interface for:

### Top Area

- **GitHub icon** (looks like a cat/octopus logo)
- **"Push Code"** button
- **"Create PR"** button
- **Upload arrow** ⬆️ icon

### Menus

- **File menu** → "Push to GitHub" or "Export"
- **Settings/Deploy** section
- **Git panel** or sidebar

### Other Locations

- **Right-click** in file explorer → "Push to GitHub"
- **Toolbar buttons** along the top
- **Action buttons** near file browser

## 🔧 **Option 2: Manual GitHub Upload**

If you absolutely cannot find the push button:

### Step 1: Go to GitHub

1. Visit: https://github.com/maxdorman1994/family-journal-2025
2. Click "Code" → "Upload files"
3. Or create a new branch

### Step 2: Download Files Manually

Since there's no download button, you'll need to:

1. **Copy files one by one** from Builder.io
2. **Create local files** with the same content
3. **Upload to GitHub**

### Step 3: Key Files to Upload

```
package.json
server/simple.ts
client/App.tsx
client/global.css
client/pages/
client/components/
server/routes/
vite.config.ts
.env.example
README.md
```

## 🚀 **Option 3: Contact Builder.io Support**

If you still can't find the push button:

1. **Use [Get Support](#reach-support)** in Builder.io
2. **Ask**: "How do I push my code to GitHub?"
3. **Mention**: You have a connected repo but can't find the push button

## 📱 **What You'll Deploy**

Once on GitHub, your app will have:

- ✅ **Working app** with Minio storage
- ✅ **Your custom configuration** (192.168.1.214:9000)
- ✅ **Simplified deployment** (no database needed)
- ✅ **Ready for FastHost** with just environment variables

## 🎯 **Environment Variables for FastHost**

```bash
MINIO_ENDPOINT=192.168.1.214
MINIO_PORT=9000
MINIO_USE_SSL=false
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=maxdorman
MINIO_SECRET_KEY=Summer07max
MINIO_BUCKET=family-journal

```
